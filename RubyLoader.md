### INTRODUCTION ###

Ruby allows for the execution of Ruby scripts within Java. ColdFusion gives us access to this functionality via our
ability to call Java objects with createObject().  RubyLoader attempts to abstract as much of this work as possible from the ColdFusion
developer so that you can leverage the power of Ruby scripts within your ColdFusion applications.
